Composer: Alberto Novello

- what was your main focus when deciding which piece to choose for the CI simulator ?

I thought a rhythmical piece was easier to follow and compare. 

- what were the musical limitations you found that came with the CI simulator ?

Mostly some frequency bands where underrepresented and disappeared. I could not bring them back using an EQ.

- once you heard the original piece through the CI simulator, what was your remixing strategy ?

Trying to reconstruct the original frequency material. I missed some bass and high definition. I also had a bit of resonances/bursts in the middle highs that needed elimination.

    - i.e. did you focus on removing/adding/highlighting elements ? re-writing melody patterns ? 

removing the high bursts and compensating the internal filtering that had occurred

- how much did you feel the CI simulator impaired the possibilities of musical expression ? 

it was quite extreme but I could nevertheless track bpms and song construction.

    - what were the musical elements that were most impaired ?

the harmonic and timbrical elements. I could not hear for example a trumpet that was in the mix. It became a noisy voice.

- did the composition you choose to process include vocals/speech? for yes/no, why? 

no vocals. Just because I don't work with singers usually.

    - do you think the use of vocals/speech could be used in a musical way with the CI simulator ?

I think so, the transient could be conserved better than in the case of a sustained instrument

- what would your approach be if you would make a new composition from scratch for the CI simulator ? 

I would try to see what elements would be mostly preserved.  Trying to compose while listening to the CI's output. 
Then work with those elements, e.g. maybe limiting my frequency range, or using only percussive elements. Or noise.

    - i.e. what elements would you focus on ? 

for sure the rhythmical parts, but also maybe frequency sweeps. A new vocabulary would need to be defined. I would imagine music that can be listened on old phones or non linear devices.
